1. Visit the [GitHub project import tool](https://github.com/new/import)
2. Paste this repo's URL: `https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-integration-planner`
3. Set ownership, new repo name and set visibility to private â€“ unless, like us, you're super transparent about your business goals
4. Hit **Begin import**

After a few minutes, you'll have a new repo ready for planning.

Then get started with the [1-getting hogpilled.md](1-getting%20hogpilled.md) file.
